running the application
-----------------------

The simplest way to run the application is to clone the repository, and use Maven to compile and run it:

    cd /tmp
    git clone https://github.com/pacificmist-0900/ScrapperSainsbury
    cd ScrapperSainsbury
    mvn compile
    mvn exec:java

I have also configured maven to package all dependencies in a single, executable JAR. To generate this JAR file
execute

    mvn package

After that you can run the application with simple:

    java -jar target/sainscraper-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

The sainscraper-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar can then be copied anywhere and executed independently. 

testing
-------

To execute tests run:

`mvn test`
